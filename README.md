# Tilemap-To-Graph
While developing a 2D Strategy game, working on Graphs rather than tilemaps would be easy for some of us. In this repository, I share an implementation of Graph data structure and an implementation of turning a tilemap into a graph, also a nice visualization of it using OnDrawGizmos. I havenâ€™t been able to find any implementation yet, hope it will be useful for some developers.

Any feedback is appreciated.

A visual explanation will be added, as soon as I get back to my home :)
